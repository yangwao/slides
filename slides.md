#### Introduction 
Viki - co-founder, technical wizard of bleeding edge implementations

### Brief history
- how we got to the ecosystem 
	- first grant from web3foundation

- winning hackathons in Ethereum & Polkadot ecosystem in 2019 - 2020

### First Pivot

- Kusama NFTs
- RMRKv1 first implementation

### Struggles
- implementation of distributed & decentralized database (Textile/ThreadDB)

- lot of features, but few worked well
- ever breaking

### Winning mentality
- changed Textile to SubQuery -> improved loading times a lot for users
- huge traction with translation contributors (16 languages?)
- quick deploy previews for anyone who has will to contribute
- bounties system for code contributors
- participating in Arweave cohort hackhathon, among finalists with PermaFrost project
- raised first money in company
- cross-chain strategy 
- deliver experimental NFT infrastructure -- metaprime.network
- bootstrapping web3 coworking space in Slovenia's mountains -- SubWork

#### Bounties program
- issued first bounties for translations

		- Astar WASM & RMRK-runtime
- being your single asset interface for NFTs on Polkadot & Kusama
	- abstract technology from user -- which parachain I'm at and does it matter?
- brewing protocol compatibility between various NFTs standards called Reactive NFTs

### RNFTs - Reactive NFTs (codename)
- performance we are doing today is based on our experiment 
- game integrations  
- protocol compatibility 
- XCM token transfers

### Experimental landscape
- we are heads down trying new things
	- abstracting NFTs from user experience

- Frontend - Nuxt3, Vue composition API & Brick

- Services - Rust-based workers - pinning, images

- Backend - FireSquid Indexers by SubSquid, GraphQL API

- Misc - packages

# Hello, minimark!

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">
<div>

- Minimalistic implementation or RMRK protocol

- Do not rely on single implementation

- Covered by unit tests

- DX oriented

- How to upgrage to v2

- Batteries included - constructing metadata, resources

</div>
  <div>
    
  ```ts
  // Use RMRK1
  import { createCollection } from '@kodadot1/minimark/v1'

  // Use RMRK2
  import { createCollection } from '@kodadot1/minimark/v2'
  
  ```

# Finally we have an API

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">
<div>

- Let's meet Uniquery

- query builder on top of subsquid

- two implementations - Builder - REST

- Why is it cool?

- Best? - no server needed

# Why is Uniquery cool?

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">
<div>
<h2>before</h2>

```graphql
  query nftListByCollectionId {
    nft: nftEntities(where: {
      collection: {id_eq: "2305670031"}}
  ) {
      id
      metadata
      currentOwner
      issuer
    }
  }
```

</div>
  <div>
  <h2>after</h2>

  ```ts
  import { getClient, ask } from '@kodadot1/uniquery'

  // using builder
  const client = getClient()
  const id = '2305670031'
  const query = client.nftListByCollectionId(id)

  // using REST
  const path = `/nftListByCollectionId/${id}`
  const result = await ask(path)

  ```

  </div>

<!--
- thanks to that, we are among the most popular
- open source NFT frontend, right after DotApps
- substrate repository on Polkadot right after Acala, Astar & Moonbeam
